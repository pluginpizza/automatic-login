== Description ==

Developers rejoice! Automatic Login logs you in automatically on your local development installation if the following conditions are met:

- The `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` constant is defined as 'local'.

Alternatively, the `AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_USER_LOGIN` and `AUTOMATIC_LOGIN_USER_PASSWORD` constants can be used to define the login credentials for Automatic Login. Note that Automatic Login does not create a user for you and the user should already exist.
